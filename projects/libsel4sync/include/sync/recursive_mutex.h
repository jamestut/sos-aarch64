/* An implementation of recursive mutexes. Assumptions are similar to pthread
 * recursive mutexes. That is, the thread that locked the mutex needs to be the
 * one who unlocks the mutex, mutexes must be unlocked as many times as they
 * are locked, etc.
 *
 * Note that the address of your IPC buffer is used as a thread ID so if you
 * have a situation where threads share an IPC buffer or do not have a valid
 * IPC buffer, these locks will not work for you.
